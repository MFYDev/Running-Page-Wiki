His father and mother sat in silence, unable to say a word, not eating or drinking, only saying that it had torn their hearts away. Compared to many running \"gods\", Bao Yinxiao is a newcomer to the sport, but despite only attempting the race in 2019, he was already able to run the full marathon in Xi'an in a time of 3 hours and a few minutes. \"That's a very elite pace for an amateur runner.\" some runners said. \"Extreme speed and ultra-long distance is my pursuit.\" is Bao Yinxiao's TikTok signature. This year, Bao Yinxiao signed up for the Lanzhou Marathon race with great expectation and made the vow to \"break three if I win the lottery\", but he never received the news that he had won. Thinking that he had no hope of winning, Bao Yinxiao then put all his energy into preparing for the Baiyin cross-country race. Faced with the first 100km cross-country in his life, Bao Yinxiao started preparing for the race more than half a year in advance. His hometown of Min County, Gansu, is located in the eastern foothills of the Tibetan Plateau and the western Qinling Longnan Mountain bordering area, in winter, the east of the county on the top of the eastern mountains, the lowest temperature can reach minus 20 degrees. On days when the county is under a snowstorm, Bao Yinxiao is still able to run outdoors for nearly six hours by himself. morning, he picked up a stick and went to poke it, only to find that \"the snake was still asleep\", which he enthusiastically posted on his own TikTok. In order to practice physical fitness, Bao Yinxiao also rode 160 kilometres between Minxian and Guangyegou. \"Run out of the sky.\" This is a WeChat name that Bao Yinxiao has used for an extremely long time, and he did. When the day finally came to race, he left a message to his fianc\u00e9e before he set off, \"Today is destined to be tough\". Among the teams competing in this race, along with the strongest first group, was his Minxian hometown friend Liu Fusheng. The two, whose identities were once a gym teacher and a student, have now become side-by-side running buddies, but unfortunately were both killed, with their step counts in WeChat Sports fixed at 33586 and 33213 respectively. On the eve of his participation in the Baiyin cross-country race, Bao Yinxiao finally received the news that he had won a ballot in the Lanzhou Marathon race, but the vow he had made to break three for the Lanzhou Marathon race was difficult to honour, and the future he had promised for his fianc\u00e9e disappeared.","title":"Bao Yinxiao"},{"location":"baiyin/cpf/","text":"In the winter of 2020 in Caohai, Weining, Guizhou, there were several heavy snowfalls. Cao Pengfei ran along the road, with snowflakes falling silently on his shoulders, and in this way, ran through the whole winter. Compared to other professional athletes, Cao Pengfei's path to cross-country running started late. His father died early and his mother was in poor health, so he had to take temporary jobs around the house in order to take care of the family and do farm work, and according to Pole Day Studio, his most recent job was as a chauffeur. It wasn't until 2020 that Cao Pengfei devoted himself to marathoning, desperately competing in races to make a living. Searching for the mark he left on the world, even today with such advanced online media, the footprints of ordinary people, like shooting stars gliding across the sky, can only leave a few strokes. We finally found Cao Pengfei at the age of 28 on Anhui TV's \"Boys and Girls Go Forward\", a sports competition programme on November 18, 2014. Wearing a bright yellow vest, he ran out of the red archway, hammering his left hand across his chest and flashing a thumbs up to the sky. The host teased him about his less than 5'7\" height and his \"small frame but big energy\", but he didn't care, and when the microphone came to his mouth, he yelled \"Very excited! which sent the MC into a shock. The final hurdle of the race was to climb up the rope with the water pouring down over his head, Cao Pengfei slipped, but immediately got up, gritted his teeth and continued upwards to finish sixth in the final in one minute and 26.4 seconds. After this experience, he competed in many marathons and steeplechase races. \"He believes he can run,\" the family wrote on social media. They gave Cao Pengfei the statistics that he has won 14 national running titles since 2016 and is also the record holder for the marathon for men in the mass category in Anhui province. In September 2020, Cao Pengfei was supposed to be the first to clock in at CP1 at the China Xixia-Fu Niu Mountain trail race in Henan. But it was a big downhill on the road, and the clocking point was another 20 metres up the hill on the right-hand side, but as the road was wide, Cao Pengfei didn't pay attention to the signposts and quickly ran past. Only after the second place passed the CP1 5 or 6 minutes later, Cao Pengfei puffed and ran back and re-punched the clock. In a cross-country race, a wrong run is a big mistake, especially when Cao Pengfei had already put a long distance between him and the second place, a wrong run would have meant a gap of more than 10 minutes between the two, and with Cao Pengfei's ability, he could have run at least two kilometres more. Even so, Cao Pengfei overtook second place and won the race. \"He's still very capable\", said one of the runners in the field. Cao Pengfei still wanted to be stronger. Last winter, he contacted the team of Ji Zhengquan, also a runner, to attend winter training in Guizhou, where he started running along the road at 9am every day, running 30km a day without fail. Sometimes, Ji Zhengquan knows that Cao Pengfei facetimes with his daughter, a cute five or six-year-old girl who also likes running. The family wrote on Weibo that on May 21, the day before the race, Cao Pengfei took two eggs stuffed by his wife and headed to Baiyin, Gansu, telling his daughter, \"Daddy won a prize this time to give you a big birthday.\" It was through the media that the family learned the sad news on May 23. The daughter asked her mother, \"What do they mean by death, you go and get Dad back.\"","title":"Cao Pengfei"},{"location":"baiyin/djh/","text":"Duan Jihong, 58, had served as a first aid runner for the 100km trail run for two consecutive years.

At the beginning of May this year, ten days before he was killed, he appeared again at the Wumeng Mountain Supercross, where the southern weather was hot and some athletes suffered from heatstroke, water and salt loss and leg cramps, and others suffered from high altitude reflexes on the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau, and Duan Jihong observed more than 20 athletes before and after. He recorded these first aid procedures in his Wechat Moments, saying that he was proud of his volunteer service and that \"he was also very rewarding\". But his daughter Duan Duan (a pseudonym) is now even more upset to see this, \"I believe my dad has some ability to save himself. Why would it be him?\" She recorded on Weibo that her father had also called 110 at 10.30pm on May 22, with a call lasting 46 seconds. \"I can't imagine how he got through those difficult 9+ hours alone, he was so cold, so cold. He must have gone to the rescue, he had experience in 100km first aid runs, he couldn't even be bothered to put his own knee pads on.\" On the morning of May 24, she met her father, \"he just seemed to be asleep, and how his mother shouted could not shout at him.\" Duan recalled that her father was a very filial person and would talk to her grandmother for over an hour every time she returned from a running race. But now Grandma can't wait for the phone call to inform her of her safety. She is 85 years old and has been in poor health, which the whole family has hide this from her so far. In her niece's recollections, her uncle is a man with the spirit of a thunderbolt, low-key and hard-working, who has struggled all her life, still studying every day in her 50s, and especially enjoying marathons in general. She was the last person in the family to know the news, apart from the 85-year-old, \"I didn't react, in a trance, how could someone so so good leave us?\" Looking through Duan Duan's Weibo feed, one can see the tiny details of the ordinary yet happy family's life over the past ten years. When Mum celebrated her birthday, her father, who was away from home, would call and \"pathetically say that he should be included in tonight's birthday\"; when he went on a business trip, Dad would bring back a small gift, and over the course of the semester, small items would be spread all over the table. In Duan's account, they got along like friends; her father would write her postcards and send her a QQ wishing her happy holidays on Children's Day, and the girl showed screenshots, \"Daddy is so cute\" ...... Then after that, the social network documented a girl working, falling in love, and moving step by step from her family into the bigger world. Just a short time ago, Duan Duan began planning her wedding, but on that dreamed of the day, there will be no father ever again who is able to hold her hand and walk into the ceremony hall.","title":"Duan Jihong"},{"location":"baiyin/hgj/","text":"34 years old, Huang Guanjun's speciality is running. He was born into a poor peasant family in Beichuan County, Mianyang, Sichuan province. At the age of one and a half, Huang Guanjun became deaf and mute and handicapped due to a medical accident. \"I wanted to get good grades, I wanted to go to university, but I couldn't understand anything the teachers said, and I cried by myself every night.\" He wrote in a book for the reporter during an interview in 2014. Since dropping out of school in his second year, Huang Guanjun has worked odd jobs in many places, as a waiter, a delivery boy, and has also learned to embroider. This can also serve as a footnote to the difficulties of employment for the deaf and dumb. However, Huang Guanjun found that fate had opened a window for him: running. He has devoted most of his energy to competing in track and field marathons. Huang Guanjun often places in various marathons, and a race can pay thousands to tens of thousands of yuan in prize money, which is an important source of income for him, according to Guyu Lab. \"He makes a living from the prize money.\" Wei Jing, a close friend of Huang Guanjun and a marathon runner, said. In 2014, Beichuan TV interviewed Huang Guanjun on the basis of a marathon as well. In the Xichang Qionghai Wetland International Open Marathon, in which about 20,000 people participated, Huang Guanjun ranked 47 th as the only disabled person to participate, and 2 nd out of more than 40 participants from Mianyang, Sichuan. At the time, 27-year-old Huang Guanjun was working at the rehabilitation centre for the disabled in the new county town of Beichuan. His QQ nickname was \"Lonely Alone\" and his signature was \"Lonely Running\". \"How much do you communicate with your father and mother?\" The reporter who came to interview him asked him on a piece of paper. He used a pen to draw a line under \"dad\" and wrote \"none\", and a line under \"mum\" and wrote \"less\". The reporter asked, \"What about with my sister? He wrote down, \"less\". In 2018, he won the 10,000m event at the National Disabled Athletics Championships, and in 2019, he won the men's full marathon hearing impairment category at the 10 th National Paralympics and 7 th Special Olympics Athletics Marathon in Tianjin. In the Yellow River Stone Forest Mountain Cross Country Race in Baiyin, Gansu, Huang Guanjun's number was M182. He paid a registration fee of RMB 1,000 and bought a new pair of sports shoes for the 100km cross country race. For a frugal man, this was a lot of money. He trained hard for the race and also trod the route at the venue in advance - for a professional runner, it didn't seem difficult to complete the trip successfully. According to Sanlian Life Weekly , survivor Zhang Xiaotao recalled that 20 kilometres after setting off, he passed Huang Guanjun, but he did not know that his opponent was hearing impaired. When he greeted Huang Guanjun, he pointed his finger at his ear and waved his hand, meaning he could not hear. Next, Zhang Xiaotao fell unconscious on the mountain and was later rescued back to the kiln by an uncle who was herding sheep. When Huang Guanjun was found again, he was already dead. Running had been his passion since he was a child, a solitary yet quiet and focused sport, and he loved to run around the village as a child. As he grew up, and for his marathon races and running training, he had collected medal prizes and pals who shared his love of running. Now, he leaves them.","title":"Huang Guanjun"},{"location":"baiyin/hl/","text":"Hu Li is already coming to the Yellow River Stone Forest for the fourth time.

She only started running at the age of 36, and then she worked hard to achieve good results, winning the women's category in the Shaanxi Baoji-Longxian Half Marathon in 2021 and finishing third in the women's category in the Xi'an Marathon in 2021. Hu Li is very thin, with long limbs, and friends say she runs like a light-hearted deer. A month ago, this fawn also won the women's category in a half marathon in Shaanxi, and when interviewed after receiving her prize, she smiled and said, \"I'll come back to the race next year!\" Hu Li was the favourite to win the women's category of the event, with many female runners keeping a close eye on her. According to an interview with Li Baihui by the public accounts Living in the South , Li caught up with Hu Li on the big climb when she saw the \"very thin and skinny\" Hu Li, unsteady on her feet and on her hands and knees as the wind blew her up the hill. At the time, Li Baihui, who had not yet realised the danger, only felt \"more passionate\" as she passed Hu Li and became the second woman. The last person to see Hu Li was Liu Xibing. According to runner He Fujun, a fellow runner visited Liu Xibing in hospital, and Liu Xibing revealed that Hu Li had left a last message for him when she felt she might be in trouble, arranging a place where she wanted to be buried. But where exactly, listening to the relay of the runner's friend, He Fujun can't remember. Hu Li used to be a freelancer and after she started her running career, she stopped working and devoted herself to running. Friends say she trains very hard, alternating between strength training, long distance and hill climbing, with only one day off a week. When she came to Baiyin this time to deal with the aftermath, only her brother came to Hu Li's home. The runners then realised that Hu Li's mother had passed away long ago and one of her brothers was also gone. The news of Hu Li's death has so far been kept from her 71-year-old father at home. It occurred to some runners that, having raced together a dozen or two times, they had never seen her partner or loved ones at the race to support her. \"She was very independent, I guess.\" Runners describe it. Many runners still don't know if she is married, and the life they have seen her show in her circle of friends is only related to running. Hu Li's running manifesto is that she wants to \"rebirth\" herself by running.","title":"Hu Li"},{"location":"baiyin/hr/","text":"The day before the Baiyin Cross Country Race, 21 May, was Huang Rui's 40 th birthday. He is a self-disciplined and tough man. Every day at six in the morning, he wakes up on time to run, five to ten kilometres, after work, he will play with his children, and at ten in the evening, he goes to bed on time, and on the days when he is not running the marathon, his rhythm is always the same. Running requires weight loss and fitness requires muscle gain. In his wife's eyes, he can still grasp even the most difficult balance. Huang Rui has been running marathons since 2009 and has participated in 88 marathons and seven 100km trail races. He used to dislike running and would smoke. After he got married, he decided to quit smoking in consideration of the health of his future children. To build up his willpower, he started running. He is a member of the Kunming Highland Triathlon Club and is described by his running friends as a very serious person. In the running world, he is nicknamed \"Double Dragon\". He and his wife have two sons, one aged 9 and one aged 6. The family also has a Springer Spaniel called Luckly. Huang Rui believes that it is more important for children to be fit than to study, so he often takes them to outdoor sports. At school, the two children also ranked top in physical fitness. He rarely talks to his wife about his work, more often than not, he listens to her problems and comes up with ideas. In the eyes of his children and his wife, Huang Rui is a role model. He is an authoritative father and a considerate husband. Huang Rui is so strict with his children that sometimes they snigger a little when he goes out to compete. \"Finally no one will bother them.\" But they both still want their dad to come back and take them to play, said Huang Rui's wife.

The gold medals taken together can hang in a rainbow at home in Qinghai. In the opinion of his good friend Ji Zhengquan, running that is because Huang Yinbin \"has no choice\", he needs to earn money by running. Because of his family's poverty, Huang Yinbin dropped out of school early and followed his father to work on a construction site in Haixi Prefecture at the age of 15, moving bricks and unloading cement. His small face was so thin that it was heartbreaking to see, and his boss couldn't bear it, so he let him help in the kitchen, \"hard to carry the three meals a day for sixty people by himself, making buns with flour, picking water and washing vegetables.\" My uncle said. When he had nothing to do, he liked to run, and by chance he was picked up by the coach and entered the gymnasium. In 2016, Huang Yinbin was already 23 years old, the age for most people to graduate from university, but Huang Yinbin had only just stepped through the doors of Xi'an Sports Institute for his freshman year by virtue of his running. The poor, simple life was still engraved in his bones. Going to a buffet hotpot at 50 or 60 yuan per capita, Huang Yinbin would lament that he hadn't been to such an upscale place. Even though he later earned income from competitions, when he went out to compete, Ji Zhengquan remembers that Huang Yinbin \"would not stay in a 100 room if he had an 80 yuan room, or an 80 room if he had a 50 room\". He would always send home the prize money from the competitions. ordinary people. He never sets an alarm clock, even if he sleeps late the night before, but at 4am the next morning, before dawn, he goes into the Qinling training near the college alone. The training for middle distance running was boring, but throughout his freshman year, Huang Yinbin almost never stopped. Such a diligent pattern continued until May 2021. Looking through Huang Yinbin's Weibo, he was always running, in the playground, by the lake, in the mountains, and even in the city, he would run in a circle around several buildings, his movement trajectory constantly overlapping and deepening. It's not that he didn't think about finding a stable job, he told his best friend and family that after running this year, he would find a stable job and forget about it, and soon he would also get married to his girlfriend. But on the day of May 22, everything came to an abrupt end. In Baiyin, Huang Yinbin's uncle said, Huang Yinbin's mother has two days and two nights without food and drink can not get up.

Min County is traditionally known as the \"Dry Dock on the Long\", where martial arts from the north and south have taken root, and people here are also very passionate about sports. In 2016, he participated in the Lanzhou International Marathon to organize the participants from Minxian County, and then became the official running team of Min County. This is the fifth year that the Min County Sunshine Running Group has been established. At first, as only the school was equipped with a relatively standard plastic playground, more than 95% of the members of the group were local teachers; nowadays, the members are in business and politics, from all walks of life. Runners say, \"Mr Liu can highly unite everyone and is very accommodating, new and old people in the team can be taken care of by him.\" A local journalist who was in close contact with the running team commented, \"Without Mr Liu, there would be no hope for the rekindling of our athletics and sports career in Min County.\" In June 2019, 30 members of the Minxian Sunshine Running Group participated collectively in the 29 th Lanzhou Marathon Race, becoming the county-level city with the best marathon results and the largest number of participants in Dingxi City. After running marathons all over Shaanxi, Gansu and Sichuan, Liu Fusheng decided to slow down, \"and then run a long distance of 100 kilometres, my running career will be complete.\" So he came to Baiyin. His original plan, after the Baiyin cross-country race, was to go to some cities he hadn't been to, and see the scenery while running. In this race, there were three runners in Min County, and Xiao Li was the only survivor. After returning to the hotel, he immediately informed everyone in the running group that Mr. Liu was lost. The group was very nervous and kept calling Liu Fusheng, but perhaps because the power was running out, the number that everyone was familiar with was switched off. Liu Fusheng's hair had gone grey earlier and the audience at the track often liked to call him Grandpa, but he was not really that old. Liu Fusheng has two sons and one daughter, his daughter is married and his youngest son has just started university in Lanzhou, and during the holidays he rides his bike alongside to protect his dad while he running the race. In the past, Liu Fusheng, as the head of the team, always had to be the one to carry the flag at the front, but unfortunately, at the farewell ceremony, the flag of the team had to be carried by the deputy leader.","title":"Liu Fusheng"},{"location":"baiyin/lj/","text":"Liang Jing was originally the favourite to win this Yellow River Stone Forest cross-country race. This is the fourth edition of this year's race, and Liang Jing has won the previous three, so it is fair to say that he is relatively familiar with the course. To many runners, Liang Jing is a \"god\" in his circle. He started running marathons in 2012, and in October 2014, he won the Jinan 12 Hour Ultra Marathon with 149.51km, breaking the Chinese 12 Hour Ultra Marathon record, and in 2015, he quit his job to become a professional runner. He has won several ultra-marathons and has also become the holder of the Chinese 12-hour ultra-marathon record. Since the epidemic, many marathons have been halted and Liang Jing, a professional runner, has been affected. His prize money from running marathons was the source of livelihood for his family. However, this year many races were resumed and in the 2021 Jiangnan 100 Mile Xuedou Mountain Cross Country Race held in April, Liang Jing won the men's 168km category with a time of 18 hours, 24 minutes and 23 seconds, breaking the course record. During this cross-country race in Xuedou Mountain, a Wuxi runner asked Liang Jing, who had won the title, if he was in good health. Liang Jing told him not to worry, saying that he was an endurance runner, but that it was really too hot for the 100 miles in Jiangnan. The runner asked if you could run slower or choose some other race as the temperature was so high. Liang Jing said, \"As you know, my child is only three years old, and I have no other skills, so I can only run, I have to earn some milk powder for my child.\" The night before the Yellow River Stone Forest cross-country race, He Fujun, who took part in the 21km race, had dinner with Liang Jing, Cao Pengfei and other friends, and we had a good chat. \"Liang Jing is a gifted runner with endurance, his kind of toughness is beyond our normal people.\" He Fujun said, \"I think Liang Jing is the first person to run 100km in China, and no one can outrun him. Because he has treated this kind of 100 kilometres as our usual training of 30 or 40 kilometres.\" Liang Jing loves to use TikTok, and posted a TikTok video at 7am on the morning of the race. In the video, Liang Jing drank millet porridge and ate three eggs. The race started at 9am and was divided into 100km, 21km (marathon half) and a health run. He Fujun took part in the 21km race and he ran first place, taking 1 hour 26 minutes. \"It happened to be the half (21km) when the prizes were awarded, and it was almost raining. It was about 11 o'clock at that point.\" As the weather began to deteriorate, He Fu Jun anxiously waited for the 100km race to progress until he waited for the bad news. According to People magazine, Liang Jing and Cao Pengfei both live in Hefei and lived in the same room before the race.

Lu Zhengyi once told his daughter that good health would not be a burden to her, so that he could be her strong backer. He also often told his daughter to order less takeaways and milk tea, to live a healthy life, and to bring home a boyfriend to show him and help her keep an eye on him. But now, Xiao Lu no longer hears these \"chatter\".

Ma Huachun said, if there are fifty to sixty children in a class, the teacher can't take care of everyone, but now I have just a dozen dolls in my class, I have enough energy to bring them all up well. When Ma Huachun was on school duty at the weekend when the students were off, his brother-in-law went to visit him and found him in the woods behind the school instead of in the dormitory, surrounded by five or six children. These dolls even came to school on weekends, just to play with Mr Ma. Ma Huachun started running the marathon three years ago, crossing the Datong River every morning to run a round trip across the province to Minhe County, which belongs to Qinghai, and every day he is the step champion in his family's WeChat movement. His eldest son, who is more than three years old, follows his yoga practice and can now stand on his bed and dabble in cartwheels, keeping his hands off the ground. In the second half of 2019, Ma Huachun passed the exam for university student village officials and took over the job of village secretary in Shanghai Shi Village in Honggu District, and had just taken up his post when he encountered an outbreak of the epidemic in early 2020. He took the initiative to call the Organization Department to apply for duty. Last year, he hardly stayed home throughout the spring, inspecting each prevention and control point and each road at the entrance of the village every day, sometimes returning home at night to have a hasty meal, a phone call came and he rushed back to the village for a meeting, arriving home late at night at eleven o'clock was a regular occurrence. Since the outbreak, there has not been a single case in Shanghai Shi Village. The family did not pay much attention to the competitions Ma Huachun had participated in over the years.

Now that her eldest son is in kindergarten and her youngest son will have his first birthday next month, she plans to take a preparation test for a stable job. She was in the process of studying when she heard that her husband was going to Baiyin and thought he was just going to run a half marathon. 22 am, Ma Huachun set off on the cross-country course in Baiyin and his wife stepped into the examination room in Lanzhou, which would have been a good day for both of them to achieve good results if no accidents had happened. At 1:58 pm, his wife felt it was almost time to finish the half-marathon and started to call him, until 7:12 pm, when seven calls went unanswered. The family remained lucky in their worry, perhaps the phone had been lost by him running? Perhaps the phone had gotten into the water because of the rain? The next day at 8am, the phone finally rang in anticipation, but came the bad news. 23 rd afternoon, the family rushed to Baiyin. The brother-in-law looked at Ma Huachun's three-year-old son, and there were tears that could not be shed.

Before he was deceased, he was a firefighter in a fire brigade in Changji Prefecture, Xinjiang, and he often came top in many group or individual competitions held by the fire brigade. Saiyiti grew up herding sheep in the mountains and fell in love with running at that time, then went to university for professional training and began to officially participate in various competitions. To his friends, he was a hard worker, shy and often with an innocent smile on his face. He is not very talkative but is multilingual, speaking not only Kirgiz, but also Uyghur, Kazakh and, with a slight accent, Chinese. The original plan was to get married this autumn, shortly before he deceased, in a house that had only recently been renovated. Saiyiti had signed up for the race in Kanas in June, and in fact, he had entered the cross-country race in Silver to train for it. He had already run the Yellow River Stone Forest cross-country race twice and had no concept of winning, nor was he doing it for the prize money, he just wanted to prepare for the race in June. He always had the dream of becoming a good athlete. on 29 th October 2017, Sayti posted a Wechat Moment, he wrote: \"Just face everything bravely, just work hard and one day you will find another you.\"","title":"Saiyiti"},{"location":"baiyin/wj/","text":"Before leaving Chongqing for the Baiyin Race, Wen Jing promised her husband, who had just married with her, that this would be the last race, and that she would not arrange any other races before holding her wedding, and was all set to become a bride. \"I just want to finish the race safely.\" The day before the race, Wen Jing wrote in her Wechat Moments and TikTok. It was her first time participating in a 100km cross-country race, and she couldn't help but be excited. According to bqshenyidu 's interview with Guo Yuting (a pseudonym), Wen Jing's roommate, the local weather was so hot that she was ready to compete in short sleeves and shorts , and Guo Yuting persuaded her to change into thin, long-sleeved trousers. When the temperature first started to plummet, Wen Jing saw a retreating male runner who had withdrawn from the race and thought that maybe the other person was wearing too little, she turned to Guo Yuting and said, \"We still must finish the race\" As the temperature continued to drop, the girls took shelter behind a semi-big rock and thought about retiring. Since it was closer to the next stop, CP3, than back to the start, Wen Jing decided to walk to the CP3 stop before retiring. A step ahead of his roommate, Wen Jing set off for CP3 with his Chongqing hometown friend Zhang Weibo. At the time, Guo Yuting saw them walking quite fast and thought they were still in good shape. Later, when Guo Yuting was heading to the CP3 site, she happened to come across the shepherd's kiln and was thus rescued. Back at the hotel, Guo Yuting rushed to check the trajectory of Zhang Weibo and Wen Jing and found that they were still positioned almost 31 kilometres from where they started, motionless. Later, it was discovered that the place where Wen Jing and Zhang Weibo had fallen was only one kilometre from the shepherd's kiln. Compared to the other greats, Wen Jing, a bank accountant, had only just begun his running career. Although she is a \"newcomer\", her friends say that her performance has improved very quickly. Some runners say that Wen Jing's performance is in the top ten of Chongqing women's marathon runners. A friend said that Wen Jing had chosen a race with a high safety margin for her first 100km challenge, \"it was said to have the least amount of climbing\". Most of Wen Jing's friends love to describe her as cheerful, smiley and sunny. In her TikTok and Wechat Moments, she has been sharing stories about running since she started running in 2019. Her husband Xiao Wu is also \"attracted by her sunshine\". This introverted man admits that he has become positive and optimistic under her guidance. Only, after getting hooked on running, she spends almost all her leisure time training and racing. According to the Fengmian news, in order to participate in the Yellow River Stone Forest Cross Country Race, Wen Jing advanced the marriage time from \"520\" (which means I Love You in Chinese) to May 10, and she took the initiative to promise her husband that she would gradually return to her family and stop competing so often afterwards, and that she would like to have two children. But before that, she wanted to seize her last moments of freedom. Wen Jing set off. Arriving in Gansu, she excitedly showed the natural beauty of the region in her Wechat Moments. More than a thousand kilometres away, her husband silently planned that he should make up for his wife's return with a marriage proposal.","title":"Wen Jing"},{"location":"baiyin/wpr/","text":"The weekend before heading to Baiyin for the cross-country race, Wu Panrong participated in the China Mountain Marathon Series and the Danxia 100 Mountain Run in Jiyuan, Henan Province and Shaoguan, Guangdong Province respectively, and he said in his TikTok, \"This weekend's race was a bit intense, next week, the first 100KM Yellow River Shilin of life, go!\" This race in Baiyin is his first 100km trail race, but the venue is not new to him. Ten years ago, he had already worked on a construction site in Baiyin before he got involved with running; ten years later, he became a god-like figure in the Shenzhen running scene, running a personal all-marathon PB of 29 minutes and 45 seconds in Wuxi in April this year. From primeval forest to stone forest and Gobi in one week, Wu Panrong said that Baiyin was \"familiar and strange\". The night before the race, Wu's best friend asked him on WeChat how he was doing and cheered him on. He replied that he was ready to run, but his friend noticed that the number book on his racing suit was buttoned up backwards and joked to him that \"elite runners should be careful about their image\". To cheer him up, his friend said, \"When you return to Shenzhen after the race safely, I will give you takeaway crawfish orders over here.\" Wu Panrong replied with a puppy nod emoji, looking in a good mood. On May 22 nd , Wu ran with his running buddy Zhang Xiaotao for most of the day. According to Zhang Xiaotao's account afterwards, \"After reaching the halfway point of the mountain, he (Wu Panrong) began to shiver all over, and started to shiver when he spoke, so I saw that he was in bad shape, and held him with my arm. I remember later, the wind was too strong and the road too slippery, so we couldn't walk together, because we were going to fall and slowly separated.\" Thunderstorm days also swept through Wu Panrong's hometown, Tongren, Guizhou. According to ahwang.cn , Wu Phanrong's father, Wu Manba, did not receive a call from Gansu because of the bad weather and the impact on his mobile phone signal. But afterwards, from his daughter-in-law's incoherent account, Wu Manba sensed that something was wrong. In order to get to Baiyin as soon as possible, Wu Manba high speed train to plane and then by car, the whole 1500 km, finally saw his son in the funeral home. Wu Panrong was born in 1989 and went out to work after graduating from junior high school. He wrote on his TikTok, \"He started running in November 2015, started with love and stayed true to it. The dream is a bright light when you are running wildly in the stormy night, a warm sympathy when you are isolated and helpless, and a persistence that you can't give up after your heart is exhausted and you are so tired that your whole body is weak.\" According to Sina Sports, when Wu Panrong worked in a factory in Longhua, Shenzhen, he often ran at four or five in the morning, sometimes even at two in the morning, in order not to miss work. In the 2016 Qingyuan Marathon, Wu Panrong's time was 3 hours 42 minutes 38 seconds, after which he set a plan to run into 3 hours in a year. In the Shenzhen Marathon in December that year, Wu Panrong achieved his goal with a time of 2 hours 50 minutes 03 seconds and won the team championship together with his teammates from the \"Donglingyuan Flying Tigers\". Every time he runs, Wu Panrong will make a short video of his route map and data screenshots and post it on TikTok to cheer himself up. In the Baiyin cross-country race, the image of Wu Panrong turning back while drinking water at a resupply point was recorded, and some runners exclaimed, \"How good it would be if we didn't keep going\".","title":"Wu Panrong"},{"location":"baiyin/wxh/","text":"After Wang Xiaohang passed away, friends set up a memorial page for him. One runner left a message in his memory: \"The first time I saw you, I thought you were cold, cool and unapproachable. We couldn't even see your back as you were walking fast. It wasn't until we walked together later in the day that we realised you were a big boy with a warm heart, and you spoke funny without being out of character.\" The common memories of the runners restore this man who is cold on the outside and hot on the inside on one journey: the campfire KTV in the northwest desert, the sleeper night train via Dunhuang, Guazhou, Jiayuguan, Lanzhou and Xi'an, the magnificent sunrise and the Milky Way in the desert ...... Now, in the hearts of all his fellow runners, his slightly shy smiling face has coexisted with this romantic world forever. Wang Xiaohang not only participates in off-roading, but also likes to hike. \"We all mention when we are on the road that when we can't run anymore, we will find a casual place to drink together and talk about the past.\" \"I wish I could still see you like the last time I saw you, when you ran past me and I called out to you Xiao Yi (Wang Xiaohang's screen name) and you turned around and smiled at me.\" One runner said.

He was 38 years old that year. When Xu Cong Hua started running marathons, his body was already past its peak of running. He does not seek fame or fortune when participating in races, it is a thorough and genuine love. He started participating in the Jiangnan 100km cross-country race in 2019, in the 168km category. The first time, he ran to more than 20 kilometres and withdrew due to injury. The second time, he also withdrew due to injury until this year, when he finally completed his first \"168\", which took him 36 hours. Every year, Xu Cong Hua takes part in more than 10 cross-country races. He is 5'5\" tall, weighs around 80kg and has eight visible abs. He has always been in great shape. Every morning at five o'clock, he gets up to run, and at the most he runs more than 700 kilometres in a month. He liked to run in the stadium next to his home and after the accident, many neighbours said, \"Isn't this the same Huazi who ran in the stadium? His best time running a marathon was 3 hours 07 minutes, in Xi'an. The next day, he went to Jinan for the 12-hour endurance race, running over 70km. He had come to Baiyin for the cross-country race with the attitude of an easy finish. It was a moderately difficult race and with a subsidy for finishing, he wanted to experience it. He expected to finish the race in 16 hours. Xu Conghua's sister said that her brother is filial to his parents, but is particularly uncommunicative and rarely speaks to his family about what is on his mind.

In 2006, under the pressure of his fast-paced job in Beijing, Yan Jun's physical condition became problematic, \"he didn't like to eat and became dizzy when he ate\". After a year of running and hiking, Yan's blood lipids went down. The couple, who love sports, often team up to participate in various marathons. At the end of the race, Yan Jun often drags his wife along, \"using all kinds of tricks to encourage her to run to the finish line as quickly as possible.\" The two of them can always be found in the North and South of Olympic Forest Park. Yan Jun is known as the \"Mad God\" because he has twice entered the \"Olympic Forest 100+\" list, but he said modestly, \"I can only call myself mad if I finish the Olympic Forest 100, but I can't count myself as a god. \" The so-called \"Olympic Forest 100+\" was once an annual event in the Beijing running community, which meant that participants had to run 10 laps around the South and North of Olympic Forest Park, a total of 107 kilometres, with the race lasting from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. In the 2017 race, Yan Jun was ranked 6 th overall with a time of 9 hours 13 minutes and 07 seconds. This year's Baiyin cross-country race, because Liu Yun to stay at home to take care of the elderly, coupled with leg injuries, only her husband Yan Jun to participate. Yan Jun, who has a science and engineering background, takes things rigorously and seriously. According to the bqshenyidu 's report, before the trip, Yan Jun used A4 paper to print out the route to and from the Yellow River Stone Forest scenic spot from Beijing: he needs to take two trips on the train, and then take the 3-hour scenic bus. The memo also included a list of more than 60 household items and items for the race, with a tick box for each item prepared. At one or two o'clock on the afternoon of the race, someone in the athletes' group reflected that the situation was not right and later sent a video of Yan Jun. According to China News Weekly and bqshenyidu , Liu Yun saw the video of her husband with his hands wrapped in a silver insulation blanket, a large bloodstain on his right forehead, his eyes closed and his brow furrowed. She realised then that the situation was bad and decided to fly straight over. Before she left, she took her husband's medical insurance card with her, thinking that he might have to stay in hospital for a while.","title":"Yan Jun"},{"location":"baiyin/zfl/","text":"Zhang Fenglian only has a pair of pink sneakers, which she bought for 25 yuan three years ago, and she usually wraps them carefully in waste newspapers and plastic bags. In the past three years, all her competitions have been run down by this pair of shoes. This is the only piece of equipment she has purchased for the competition. Zhang Fenglian, 50, was a doctor at the Gansu Provincial People's Hospital and married her husband Chen Fahai, 17 years her senior, at the age of 28. 42, when she found out she was pregnant with her second child, a boy like her eldest, she lost her job at the hospital and made her living by selling vegetables in the nearby villages and occasionally treating villagers for minor illnesses. Every morning before dawn, Chen Fahai goes to the nearby vegetable market and wholesales a hundred or so pounds of vegetables, which he loads into Zhang Fenglian's back basket and carries to the nearby villages to sell during the day. The only cheap vegetables that sell well in the villages are cabbages and leeks, which can earn 30 yuan a catty. Zhang Fenglian has a strong personality, and her family will not come back until the vegetables are sold. They rented a rough house of less than 30 square metres in the county, and the rent was more than 10,000 yuan a year. The family ate vegetarian noodles every day of the year, buying a 70 yuan bag of flour and rolling out noodles that would last for almost a month, and eating the rotten leaves in the basket that others had picked up and could not sell. Only when her children had a craving would Zhang Fenglian spend a dollar to buy two buns to improve their diet. In 2016, a flyer for the Lanzhou New Area Half Marathon was slipped into Zhang Fenglian's hand. Seeing that the top 20 finishers would receive prizes starting at 200 yuan, Zhang Fenglian thought that she too was a good runner. She has been training herself ever since, waking up at 3am, running 30km along the Yellow River, going home at 6am to make breakfast for her children, then eating two whole bowls of noodles before carrying a hundred pounds of vegetables around the village. After getting the 200 yuan prize money for the Lanzhou half-marathon, she started to participate in races all over Gansu and the country, half-marathons, marathons, cross-country, all of them. Her requirement for herself was to finish in 10 hours, so that she could catch the return train that night and not have to spend more money on accommodation for one night. There was no room for the large number of medals at home, so Zhang Fenglian hung them up with her towel. The clothes and backpacks for the race were all given out by the organisers of the previous race, and she took the sportswear home so that she could give the loose ones to her 17-year-old son and the tight ones to her younger son. When she runs in the morning, she can't afford to wear the 25 yuan pink sneakers, so she wears the shoes she picks up from the nearby rubbish dump, and wears whatever shoes she finds. Chen Fahai, 67, is too old to work and can only pick up bottles at nearby scenic spots. By running so hard, Zhang Fenglian is able to increase her family's annual income by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan to pay for her children's schooling. Chen Fahai has heard Zhang Fenglian talk about the Baiyin race, which she has participated in twice before, and her biggest impression is that the roads are dangerous and supplies are inadequate. She tries to pack as lightly as possible for other races, but when she runs the Baiyin cross-country race, she has to carry two bottles of mineral water on her back for fear of running out of water at the midway supply station. These two bottles of mineral water could not save her life on that windy and rainy afternoon. When Chen Fahai arrived at the funeral parlour, he saw her belongings: a set of sportswear that had been given out free of charge by the organisers when she took part in the race in Zhangye, and a shoulder bag whose zip had broken when he picked it up from the dump. He looked left and right, but the pair of pink sneakers had disappeared.","title":"Zhang Fenglian"},{"location":"baiyin/zwb/","text":"The Baiyin cross-country race was the first 100km trail run that Zhang Weibo participated in. Zhang Weibo is the only son in his family. After graduating from junior high school, he went to Guangdong to work and later returned to Chongqing to work. He worked in an electronics factory, as a waiter and a security guard, but many jobs were not long enough for him and he found them tiring and uninteresting. Unexpectedly, he fell in love with the marathon, a sport that most people find tiring and boring. Before he deceased, he worked as a salesman in a motorbike shop, earning only about 4,000 yuan a month. He had few daily expenses, but was willing to spend money on more than 20,000 yuan of off-road racing equipment. When he participated in races around Chongqing, he often rode his motorbike there to save on transport and accommodation costs. Zhang has been a sportsman since he was a child, and in his early 20s he had two full rides on the 318 National Highway. In his spare time, he often shares his fitness and racing routine on his personal social media platforms. He makes a thorough training plan before races and goes fishing when he has time. Five years ago, his father, Zhang Rui Chun, took out a loan to buy a second-hand home for Zhang Weibo, hoping that he would marry and have children and live a peaceful life without running around. Zhang Weibo told his father every time that he just liked to run. His father would nag him, but he never argued back.
