Two months ago, Bao Yinxiao had just gotten engaged to his fiancée, and as the only son of three generations, the family felt that "the sky was falling" at his sudden death.

His father and mother sat in silence, unable to say a word, not eating or drinking, only saying that it had torn their hearts away.

Compared to many running "gods", Bao Yinxiao is a newcomer to the sport, but despite only attempting the race in 2019, he was already able to run the full marathon in Xi'an in a time of 3 hours and a few minutes. "That's a very elite pace for an amateur runner." some runners said.

"Extreme speed and ultra-long distance is my pursuit." is Bao Yinxiao's TikTok signature. This year, Bao Yinxiao signed up for the Lanzhou Marathon race with great expectation and made the vow to "break three if I win the lottery", but he never received the news that he had won.

Thinking that he had no hope of winning, Bao Yinxiao then put all his energy into preparing for the Baiyin cross-country race. Faced with the first 100km cross-country in his life, Bao Yinxiao started preparing for the race more than half a year in advance.

His hometown of Min County, Gansu, is located in the eastern foothills of the Tibetan Plateau and the western Qinling Longnan Mountain bordering area, in winter, the east of the county on the top of the eastern mountains, the lowest temperature can reach minus 20 degrees. On days when the county is under a snowstorm, Bao Yinxiao is still able to run outdoors for nearly six hours by himself.

morning, he picked up a stick and went to poke it, only to find that "the snake was still asleep", which he enthusiastically posted on his own TikTok. In order to practice physical fitness, Bao Yinxiao also rode 160 kilometres between Minxian and Guangyegou.

"Run out of the sky." This is a WeChat name that Bao Yinxiao has used for an extremely long time, and he did.

When the day finally came to race, he left a message to his fiancée before he set off, "Today is destined to be tough". Among the teams competing in this race, along with the strongest first group, was his Minxian hometown friend Liu Fusheng. The two, whose identities were once a gym teacher and a student, have now become side-by-side running buddies, but unfortunately were both killed, with their step counts in WeChat Sports fixed at 33586 and 33213 respectively.

On the eve of his participation in the Baiyin cross-country race, Bao Yinxiao finally received the news that he had won a ballot in the Lanzhou Marathon race, but the vow he had made to break three for the Lanzhou Marathon race was difficult to honour, and the future he had promised for his fiancée disappeared.
