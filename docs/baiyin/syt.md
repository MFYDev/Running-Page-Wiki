Saiyiti is a native of Ahechi County, Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang, of Kirgiz ethnicity, and the winner of the men's marathon of the 2018 Wild Walk Batu-Honghai Huyang Ultra Marathon. He is 26 years old.

Saiyiti has four brothers and one sister, and he is the youngest child in his family and the only one who went to university. 2018, Saiyiti graduated from Xinjiang Engineering College with a bachelor's degree in automation. Before he was deceased, he was a firefighter in a fire brigade in Changji Prefecture, Xinjiang, and he often came top in many group or individual competitions held by the fire brigade.

Saiyiti grew up herding sheep in the mountains and fell in love with running at that time, then went to university for professional training and began to officially participate in various competitions.

To his friends, he was a hard worker, shy and often with an innocent smile on his face. He is not very talkative but is multilingual, speaking not only Kirgiz, but also Uyghur, Kazakh and, with a slight accent, Chinese. The original plan was to get married this autumn, shortly before he deceased, in a house that had only recently been renovated.

Saiyiti had signed up for the race in Kanas in June, and in fact, he had entered the cross-country race in Silver to train for it. He had already run the Yellow River Stone Forest cross-country race twice and had no concept of winning, nor was he doing it for the prize money, he just wanted to prepare for the race in June.

He always had the dream of becoming a good athlete. on 29th October 2017, Sayti posted a Wechat Moment, he wrote: "Just face everything bravely, just work hard and one day you will find another you."
