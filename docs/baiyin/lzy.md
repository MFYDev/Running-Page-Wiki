At 7:50am on the 30th, at Lanzhou Zhongchuan International Airport, Lu Zhengyi's daughter Xiao Lu (a pseudonym) pulled out her mobile phone and sent out a tweet: Dad, I'm taking you home. Let's go home warmly and no freeze anymore.

A week ago, Xiao Lu met her father at the funeral home after several trips. She described the scene to reporters in an autobiography by *All Now*. Her father was wearing short sleeves and shorts, with a towel wrapped around his hands that he usually uses for running and a mobile phone strapped to his leg. Fawn noticed that her father's hands were clenched, and she guessed that he was probably too cold.

She later posted on her Weibo account under the ID "Dad, I'm here to warm your hands" again, "You need to wear a coat in the flatlands, so how cold should Dad and other victims be when they were on the mountain? How cold it was?! How cold it was?!"

In her memories, her father was warm. On the way to run training, when she saw elderly people setting up stalls on the roadside, her father would buy those vegetables and fruits just so they could go home early; her father loved cleanliness and always polished her piano so that there was no dust at all; he had a bottle of good wine that he had kept for years and wanted to wait for his daughter's wedding day to open it with the whole family ...... In the plane rushing to the scene of the Baiyin accident, Xiao Lu wrote long words, between the lines all the tender details of the twenty years father and daughter spent together, but writing was always interrupted by a stronger pain, she almost begged in a tone of voice, "Take away one of my things, go and exchange it for dad back".

Xiao Lu said that her father had always been in good health and had started running marathons four or five years ago, running for two hours every morning. A few days ago, the family sorted through the large and small medals and certificates that Lu Zhengyi had won over the years, lining them up in order by year, with the 2017 medals already rusting and the 2020 medals still brand new, all traces of his efforts.

Lu Zhengyi once told his daughter that good health would not be a burden to her, so that he could be her strong backer. He also often told his daughter to order less takeaways and milk tea, to live a healthy life, and to bring home a boyfriend to show him and help her keep an eye on him. But now, Xiao Lu no longer hears these "chatter".

Her mother has a heart condition and diabetes, and when the sad news came, this Z-generation girl had to take on the responsibility of a family and face the cruelest test of life head on.

After a two-hour flight, the plane landed at Guiyang Longdongbao Airport. Near noon, Xiao Lu posted a happy photo of her father before the game on Weibo, where she wrote, "This is M160, the hero Lu Zhengyi, my dearest dad, we are finally home."
