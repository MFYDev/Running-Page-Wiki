The day before the Baiyin Cross Country Race, 21 May, was Huang Rui's 40th birthday.

He is a self-disciplined and tough man. Every day at six in the morning, he wakes up on time to run, five to ten kilometres, after work, he will play with his children, and at ten in the evening, he goes to bed on time, and on the days when he is not running the marathon, his rhythm is always the same.

Running requires weight loss and fitness requires muscle gain. In his wife's eyes, he can still grasp even the most difficult balance.

Huang Rui has been running marathons since 2009 and has participated in 88 marathons and seven 100km trail races. He used to dislike running and would smoke. After he got married, he decided to quit smoking in consideration of the health of his future children. To build up his willpower, he started running. He is a member of the Kunming Highland Triathlon Club and is described by his running friends as a very serious person. In the running world, he is nicknamed "Double Dragon".

He and his wife have two sons, one aged 9 and one aged 6. The family also has a Springer Spaniel called Luckly.

Huang Rui believes that it is more important for children to be fit than to study, so he often takes them to outdoor sports. At school, the two children also ranked top in physical fitness. He rarely talks to his wife about his work, more often than not, he listens to her problems and comes up with ideas.

In the eyes of his children and his wife, Huang Rui is a role model. He is an authoritative father and a considerate husband.

Huang Rui is so strict with his children that sometimes they snigger a little when he goes out to compete. "Finally no one will bother them." But they both still want their dad to come back and take them to play, said Huang Rui's wife.

In his eulogy, a friend said he was a good son, a good father and a good husband. He loved sports all his life.
