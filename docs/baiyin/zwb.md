The Baiyin cross-country race was the first 100km trail run that Zhang Weibo participated in. Zhang Weibo is the only son in his family. After graduating from junior high school, he went to Guangdong to work and later returned to Chongqing to work. He worked in an electronics factory, as a waiter and a security guard, but many jobs were not long enough for him and he found them tiring and uninteresting. Unexpectedly, he fell in love with the marathon, a sport that most people find tiring and boring.

Before he deceased, he worked as a salesman in a motorbike shop, earning only about 4,000 yuan a month. He had few daily expenses, but was willing to spend money on more than 20,000 yuan of off-road racing equipment. When he participated in races around Chongqing, he often rode his motorbike there to save on transport and accommodation costs.

Zhang has been a sportsman since he was a child, and in his early 20s he had two full rides on the 318 National Highway. In his spare time, he often shares his fitness and racing routine on his personal social media platforms. He makes a thorough training plan before races and goes fishing when he has time.

Five years ago, his father, Zhang Rui Chun, took out a loan to buy a second-hand home for Zhang Weibo, hoping that he would marry and have children and live a peaceful life without running around. Zhang Weibo told his father every time that he just liked to run. His father would nag him, but he never argued back.

Today, his elderly father Zhang Rui Chun and his wife are carrying a debt of over 400,000 yuan and do not know where the future lies.
