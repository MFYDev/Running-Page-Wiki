In 2019, at a sharing session, Huang Yinbin talked about the biggest difficulty he encountered - one year Zhangye 50km trail run, halfway through the run, his legs cramped up, "it was particularly painful, and I wouldn't run off-road after that."

But after Zhangye, he participated in one cross-country race after another and won one championship after another: 2018 Daning International Cross-Country Running 50km champion, 2019 Himalayan Extreme Cross-Country Running 50km champion, 2019 Moganshan TNF International Cross-Country Running 50km champion ...... The gold medals taken together can hang in a rainbow at home in Qinghai.

In the opinion of his good friend Ji Zhengquan, running that is because Huang Yinbin "has no choice", he needs to earn money by running.

Because of his family's poverty, Huang Yinbin dropped out of school early and followed his father to work on a construction site in Haixi Prefecture at the age of 15, moving bricks and unloading cement. His small face was so thin that it was heartbreaking to see, and his boss couldn't bear it, so he let him help in the kitchen, "hard to carry the three meals a day for sixty people by himself, making buns with flour, picking water and washing vegetables." My uncle said. When he had nothing to do, he liked to run, and by chance he was picked up by the coach and entered the gymnasium.

In 2016, Huang Yinbin was already 23 years old, the age for most people to graduate from university, but Huang Yinbin had only just stepped through the doors of Xi'an Sports Institute for his freshman year by virtue of his running.

The poor, simple life was still engraved in his bones. Going to a buffet hotpot at 50 or 60 yuan per capita, Huang Yinbin would lament that he hadn't been to such an upscale place. Even though he later earned income from competitions, when he went out to compete, Ji Zhengquan remembers that Huang Yinbin "would not stay in a 100 room if he had an 80 yuan room, or an 80 room if he had a 50 room". He would always send home the prize money from the competitions.

ordinary people. He never sets an alarm clock, even if he sleeps late the night before, but at 4am the next morning, before dawn, he goes into the Qinling training near the college alone. The training for middle distance running was boring, but throughout his freshman year, Huang Yinbin almost never stopped.

Such a diligent pattern continued until May 2021. Looking through Huang Yinbin's Weibo, he was always running, in the playground, by the lake, in the mountains, and even in the city, he would run in a circle around several buildings, his movement trajectory constantly overlapping and deepening.

It's not that he didn't think about finding a stable job, he told his best friend and family that after running this year, he would find a stable job and forget about it, and soon he would also get married to his girlfriend.

But on the day of May 22, everything came to an abrupt end.

In Baiyin, Huang Yinbin's uncle said, Huang Yinbin's mother has two days and two nights without food and drink can not get up. They are simple farmers, have not encountered such a thing. They want to know, how did people die? They want to take Huang Yinbin home.
