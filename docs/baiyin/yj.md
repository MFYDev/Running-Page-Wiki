Yan Jun's connection with running is related to his wife Liu Yun (pseudonym). In 2006, under the pressure of his fast-paced job in Beijing, Yan Jun's physical condition became problematic, "he didn't like to eat and became dizzy when he ate". After a year of running and hiking, Yan's blood lipids went down.

The couple, who love sports, often team up to participate in various marathons. At the end of the race, Yan Jun often drags his wife along, "using all kinds of tricks to encourage her to run to the finish line as quickly as possible."

The two of them can always be found in the North and South of Olympic Forest Park. Yan Jun is known as the "Mad God" because he has twice entered the "Olympic Forest 100+" list, but he said modestly, "I can only call myself mad if I finish the Olympic Forest 100, but I can't count myself as a god. "

The so-called "Olympic Forest 100+" was once an annual event in the Beijing running community, which meant that participants had to run 10 laps around the South and North of Olympic Forest Park, a total of 107 kilometres, with the race lasting from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. In the 2017 race, Yan Jun was ranked 6th overall with a time of 9 hours 13 minutes and 07 seconds.

This year's Baiyin cross-country race, because Liu Yun to stay at home to take care of the elderly, coupled with leg injuries, only her husband Yan Jun to participate.

Yan Jun, who has a science and engineering background, takes things rigorously and seriously. According to the *bqshenyidu*'s report, before the trip, Yan Jun used A4 paper to print out the route to and from the Yellow River Stone Forest scenic spot from Beijing: he needs to take two trips on the train, and then take the 3-hour scenic bus. The memo also included a list of more than 60 household items and items for the race, with a tick box for each item prepared.

At one or two o'clock on the afternoon of the race, someone in the athletes' group reflected that the situation was not right and later sent a video of Yan Jun. According to *China News Weekly* and *bqshenyidu*, Liu Yun saw the video of her husband with his hands wrapped in a silver insulation blanket, a large bloodstain on his right forehead, his eyes closed and his brow furrowed. She realised then that the situation was bad and decided to fly straight over. Before she left, she took her husband's medical insurance card with her, thinking that he might have to stay in hospital for a while.
