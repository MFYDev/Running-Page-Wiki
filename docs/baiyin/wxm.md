His son has not yet started a family and his youngest daughter is only 14 years old, his wife does not work and the whole family depends on Wu Xinming alone for support. The eldest in the family, Wu Xinming is honest and upright, and is a role model to his brothers. "His own family is average, but he supports his parents and takes care of his brothers, and he always comes back to see his parents on their birthdays or important holidays." Ms Zhang, a sister-in-law, choked up as she recalled.

At 5am on the morning of May 23, Ms Zhang heard the sad news of her elder brother's death from a call from her nephew. "We didn't dare cry out, afraid that our parents would find out. At that time, how I wished it was a fake news." Ms Zhang said. At 8am, after the news was confirmed, Wu Xinming's 73-year-old father fainted on the spot.
