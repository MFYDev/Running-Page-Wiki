Before leaving Chongqing for the Baiyin Race, Wen Jing promised her husband, who had just married with her, that this would be the last race, and that she would not arrange any other races before holding her wedding, and was all set to become a bride.

"I just want to finish the race safely." The day before the race, Wen Jing wrote in her Wechat Moments and TikTok.

It was her first time participating in a 100km cross-country race, and she couldn't help but be excited. According to *bqshenyidu*'s interview with Guo Yuting (a pseudonym), Wen Jing's roommate, the local weather was so hot that she was ready to compete in short sleeves and shorts , and Guo Yuting persuaded her to change into thin, long-sleeved trousers.

When the temperature first started to plummet, Wen Jing saw a retreating male runner who had withdrawn from the race and thought that maybe the other person was wearing too little, she turned to Guo Yuting and said, "We still must finish the race"

As the temperature continued to drop, the girls took shelter behind a semi-big rock and thought about retiring. Since it was closer to the next stop, CP3, than back to the start, Wen Jing decided to walk to the CP3 stop before retiring. A step ahead of his roommate, Wen Jing set off for CP3 with his Chongqing hometown friend Zhang Weibo. At the time, Guo Yuting saw them walking quite fast and thought they were still in good shape.

Later, when Guo Yuting was heading to the CP3 site, she happened to come across the shepherd's kiln and was thus rescued. Back at the hotel, Guo Yuting rushed to check the trajectory of Zhang Weibo and Wen Jing and found that they were still positioned almost 31 kilometres from where they started, motionless.

Later, it was discovered that the place where Wen Jing and Zhang Weibo had fallen was only one kilometre from the shepherd's kiln.

Compared to the other greats, Wen Jing, a bank accountant, had only just begun his running career. Although she is a "newcomer", her friends say that her performance has improved very quickly. Some runners say that Wen Jing's performance is in the top ten of Chongqing women's marathon runners.

A friend said that Wen Jing had chosen a race with a high safety margin for her first 100km challenge, "it was said to have the least amount of climbing".

Most of Wen Jing's friends love to describe her as cheerful, smiley and sunny. In her TikTok and Wechat Moments, she has been sharing stories about running since she started running in 2019.

Her husband Xiao Wu is also "attracted by her sunshine". This introverted man admits that he has become positive and optimistic under her guidance. Only, after getting hooked on running, she spends almost all her leisure time training and racing. According to the Fengmian news, in order to participate in the Yellow River Stone Forest Cross Country Race, Wen Jing advanced the marriage time from "520" (which means *I Love You* in Chinese) to May 10, and she took the initiative to promise her husband that she would gradually return to her family and stop competing so often afterwards, and that she would like to have two children. But before that, she wanted to seize her last moments of freedom.

Wen Jing set off. Arriving in Gansu, she excitedly showed the natural beauty of the region in her Wechat Moments. More than a thousand kilometres away, her husband silently planned that he should make up for his wife's return with a marriage proposal.
