Liu Fusheng is a physical education teacher at the second secondary school in Min County, Gansu, and will be retiring in two months, but he feels he can't stay idle.

Min County is traditionally known as the "Dry Dock on the Long", where martial arts from the north and south have taken root, and people here are also very passionate about sports. In 2016, he participated in the Lanzhou International Marathon to organize the participants from Minxian County, and then became the official running team of Min County.

This is the fifth year that the Min County Sunshine Running Group has been established. At first, as only the school was equipped with a relatively standard plastic playground, more than 95% of the members of the group were local teachers; nowadays, the members are in business and politics, from all walks of life.

Runners say, "Mr Liu can highly unite everyone and is very accommodating, new and old people in the team can be taken care of by him." A local journalist who was in close contact with the running team commented, "Without Mr Liu, there would be no hope for the rekindling of our athletics and sports career in Min County." In June 2019, 30 members of the Minxian Sunshine Running Group participated collectively in the 29th Lanzhou Marathon Race, becoming the county-level city with the best marathon results and the largest number of participants in Dingxi City.

After running marathons all over Shaanxi, Gansu and Sichuan, Liu Fusheng decided to slow down, "and then run a long distance of 100 kilometres, my running career will be complete." So he came to Baiyin.

His original plan, after the Baiyin cross-country race, was to go to some cities he hadn't been to, and see the scenery while running.

In this race, there were three runners in Min County, and Xiao Li was the only survivor. After returning to the hotel, he immediately informed everyone in the running group that Mr. Liu was lost. The group was very nervous and kept calling Liu Fusheng, but perhaps because the power was running out, the number that everyone was familiar with was switched off.

Liu Fusheng's hair had gone grey earlier and the audience at the track often liked to call him Grandpa, but he was not really that old. Liu Fusheng has two sons and one daughter, his daughter is married and his youngest son has just started university in Lanzhou, and during the holidays he rides his bike alongside to protect his dad while he running the race.

In the past, Liu Fusheng, as the head of the team, always had to be the one to carry the flag at the front, but unfortunately, at the farewell ceremony, the flag of the team had to be carried by the deputy leader.
